<h1>Image encryption using RSA Crypto-system</h1>

Encryption is done to the individual RGB values of each pixel to change the colour. 
Decryption is done in a similar manner to retrieve the original colour of the pixel.

This process is effecient for smaller images compared to larger images. RSA is not effecient when working with images that have a high pixel density.

RSA_rgb.ipynb contains source code for encryption and decryption.
