<h1>Image encryption using RSA Algorithm<\h1>

Encryption is done by encrypting the individual RGB values of each pixel to change the colour. 
Decryption is done in a similar manner to retrieve the original colour of the pixel.

Effecient for smaller images compared to larger images. RSA is not effecient when working with images that have a high pixel density.
